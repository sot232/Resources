# Topics that I Want to Study in the Future

- Dummy Classifier.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM), one of the well-known kernelized classification techniques. 
- Oversampling.
- Undersampling: It can be good when you have a ton of data. You will remove information that may be valuable.
- Synthetic Samples. (SMOTE, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, etc)
- SMOTE: It "uses a nearest neighbors algorithm to generate new and synthetic data."
- Graph Theory
- Vertex Classification. It is a task of assigning categories to each. vertex in a graph based on both vertex attributes and link structure.
