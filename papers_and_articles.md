<details><summary><strong>Dealing with Imbalanced Data</strong></summary>
<p>

Used the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset which has only 0.17% of transactions being classified as fraudulent. For imbalanced data, 1. you would have a problem with getting a good accuracy. 2. you would have a performace issue.

To resolve your problems,
1. change the performance metric. 
(Try Using 1. confusion matrix. 2. precision. 3. recall. 4. F1 score. to get better insight.) 
2. change the algorithm. 
(Decision Trees, RF, etc) 
3. Resampling techniques (Oversample minority class. Undersample majority class.)
4. Generate synthetic samples. (SMOTE)
